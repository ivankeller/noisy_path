# Noisy Path

(README generated by Github Copilot and lightly modified by me.)

Welcome to the Noisy Path codebase! This repository contains a Python project that generates and analyzes noisy paths.

## Description

The Noisy Path project aims to simulate and analyze paths affected by noise. It provides a set of tools and algorithms to generate random paths with varying levels of noise, and offers methods to analyze and visualize the characteristics of these paths.

## Features

- Generate random paths with adjustable noise levels
- Calculate statistical measures of path characteristics
- Visualize paths and their noise profiles
- Compare different noise models and their effects on paths

## Getting Started

To get started with the Noisy Path project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the codebase and familiarize yourself with the available modules and functions.
4. Run the example scripts in the `examples` directory to see the project in action.
5. Start experimenting with different noise levels and analyzing the generated paths.
